# VitaSX2 - NetherSX2 Prebuilt APKs
These are **unofficial** apks for NetherSX2 to expand on the amazing work already done by Anon and EZOnTheEyes

They aim to do the following:
* Remove the unnecessary ad services bloat left in the apk
* Fix the RetroAchievements Notifications
* Expose more Global settings in the App Settings to the user
* Update the GameDB, Controller Support, and the Widescreen and No-Interlace Patches
* Add additional AetherSX2/NetherSX2 spesific fixes to the GameDB

# Downloads
**When installing, click show more and install wituout verifying. This shows because of the default signature i use. This is a common false positive, nothing to worry about. You could also click install with verifying, it might work.**
